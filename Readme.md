 - A Truss is essentially a triangulated system of straight   
   interconnected structural elements.
 - The Purpose of this program is to  analyze all 2D/3D Trusses with all degrees of freedom using stiffness method (matrix analysis) under any kind of concentrated nodal  loadings (F_x,  F_y, F_z) and to submit values of supportive reactions, nodal displacements, axial forces and element stresses and strain as MATLAB Output.
 - General feature of this program includes one    ‘m-file’ and an ‘Excel’ input file, which are required to run this    program.-
 -  Using this program is very easy and user-friendly. For more    information and to learn how to use this   program, please refer this  [presentation](https://github.com/deepakraina99/TrussAnalysis_FEM/blob/master/src/Presentation.pdf)
